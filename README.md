# Power-consumption
In this respitory, I analyze electricity consumption in Tetouan City using data from [the UCI Machine Learning Respitory ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/849/power+consumption+of+tetouan+city). I briefly show how to import a cvs file, clean dates and agrregate date consumed by each zone. I conclude by running regressions to explore the relationship between electicity consumption in a particluar zone and other factors.
